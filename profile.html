                Hi,  my name is Duval Barrett and I am a student at Devmountain.  I was born and raised in Bronx, New York, so in my eyes there's no place better than New York. I have been attending Devmountain for three weeks now and I've enjoyed every minute. I've had the opportunity to learn so many fascinating things not only about coding, but about myself as well. I've met many new people from all across the United States you share similar and different interests than me.
             </p>

             <p>
                Before attending Devmountain I worked as a Physical therapy aide where I assisted Physical Therapists with patients from the ages of young to elderly in exercising and returning to optimal health through various therapy routines. Prior to that I worked as a Pharmacy Technician where I made and dispensed medications for patients. Before, Devmountain my initial goal was to become a Doctor, but during the covid-era I realized that it wasn't the right path for me.
             </p>

             <p>Alright, alright enough about the boring things in my life, lets discuss more exciting things. I love playing and watching sports, my favorites being basketball, football, track and field and occasionally soccer. I'm an avid gamer, who enjoys playing sport games, every now and then I'll play RPG and adventure games, with NBA 2k and Call of Duty being my favorites. 

             </p>
